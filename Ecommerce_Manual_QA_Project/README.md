# Ecommerce Manual QA Project

This project demonstrates my end-to-end manual Quality Assurance process for a sample e-commerce web application. 
It includes a full test plan, test scenarios, detailed test cases, and documented bug reports. 
The goal of this project is to showcase my ability to analyze requirements, create structured test documentation, 
execute functional tests, and report defects clearly and professionally.
